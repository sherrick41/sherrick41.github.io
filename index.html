    I enjoy working outside, working on mowers, working with computers, and building things out of spare/broken parts.
    I also like to recyle metal to help keep what i can out of the landfill and get some extra cash for college. Recyling metal
    is how i bought my first truck. 
    
    I also am selling my truck because i bought a car for college. If you are interested in buying a 2000 Ford Ranger,
    here is a link http://limaohio.craigslist.org/cto/5736334293.html to my posting. 
    
    One interesintg and unique thing that i have been able to do is that i caught a stergeon by hand up in Wisconcin.
